# Git for collaborative work

## Workshop requirements
In order to get lots of hands-on experience during the workshop, you need to set up the tools we will be using in advance on your own device. Please make sure you have taken all the following steps __before__ the workshop and ask me for help on Slack or via mail if you encounter issues.

* __Get familiar with the terminal__. During the workshop we will use Git via the command line. If you have previously used git via a GUI, that is completely fine, however, in order to follow along you should be comfortable with basic commands like ``ls``, ``cd``, ``mkdir`` . If you have never touched the terminal, don't worry! [This](https://blog.balthazar-rouberol.com/discovering-the-terminal) friendly introduction should provide you with everything you need to know for a start.
* __Make an account__ on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and __share your username__ via the [google form](https://forms.gle/9Ae4bGvQAv7cqws57), so I can add you as contributor to our Workshop GitHub repository.
* __Set up your local Git__. You have already used Git before, so I assume you have an up-to-date Git version installed (check with ```git --version```) and set up your credentials as well as authentication. If you haven't and need help. Please contact me before the workshop.
* __Clone the workshop repo__. https://github.com/aranas/Git_Workshop_Basics2022
