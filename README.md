## Using Git & GitHub for collaborative work

This workshop will introduce the collaborative workflow when using Git & GitHub. You are familiar with the basic local Git cycle but would like to learn how to use Git version control in a team? We will go over commonly used GitHub features such as issues, forking and pull requests, when and how to use branches as well as how to tidy up your commit history. Importantly, we will dare to do some live collaborative work during the workshop, which means you will get first-hand experience on how to handle merge conflicts as things get messy.

Basic previous knowledge of local Git cycle required (e.g. you should know what push, pull, commit and add are and why this isn’t the correct order of those commands. If you don’t, better choose Workshop “From zero to git-pull-push”). You should also have at least already cloned a GitHub repo in the past. In this workshop we will use Git from the command line, so you should be familiar with the basics on the command line and have your configuration set-up (e.g. set your git identity and configured text editor of your choice). You should also create a GitHub account if you haven’t already.
